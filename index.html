        <h2>The Legend of Lord Rama</h2>
        <p>
            According to Hindu mythology, Diwali marks the return of <strong>Lord Rama</strong> to his kingdom <strong>Ayodhya</strong> 
            after a 14-year exile and his victory over the demon king <strong>Ravana</strong>. 
            The people of Ayodhya welcomed Lord Rama, Goddess Sita, and Lord Lakshmana by lighting rows of oil lamps (diyas) 
            to celebrate their return and the triumph of good over evil. 
            This is why Diwali is also known as the <em>‚ÄúFestival of Lights.‚Äù</em>
        </p>
